# Examples:

#
#   # Force access via SSL connection and set the "secure" flag on cookies
#   config.force_ssl = true if Rails.env.production?
#
#   # Use the Inline adapter for Active Job when you don't want to
#   # set up external systems like Sidekiq and Redis.
#   config.active_job.queue_adapter = :inline
