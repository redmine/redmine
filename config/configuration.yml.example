  # Absolute path to the directory where attachments are stored.
  # The default is the 'files' directory in your Redmine instance.
  # Your Redmine instance needs to have write permission on this
  # directory.
  # Examples:
  # attachments_storage_path: /var/redmine/files
  # attachments_storage_path: D:/redmine/files

  # Configuration of the autologin cookie.
  # autologin_cookie_name: the name of the cookie (default: autologin)

  # Configuration of SCM executable command.
  #
  # Absolute path (e.g. /usr/local/bin/hg) or command name (e.g. hg.exe, bzr.exe)
  # On Windows + CRuby, *.cmd, *.bat (e.g. hg.cmd, bzr.bat) does not work.
  #
  # On Windows + JRuby 1.6.2, path which contains spaces does not work.
  # For example, "C:\Program Files\TortoiseHg\hg.exe".
  # If you want to this feature, you need to install to the path which does not contains spaces.
  # For example, "C:\TortoiseHg\hg.exe".
  #
  # Examples:
  # scm_subversion_command: svn                                       # (default: svn)

  # SCM paths validation.
  #
  # You can configure a regular expression for each SCM that will be used to
  # validate the path of new repositories (eg. path entered by users with the
  # "Manage repositories" permission and path returned by reposman.rb).
  # The regexp will be wrapped with \A \z, so it must match the whole path.
  # And the regexp is case sensitive.
  #
  # You can match the project identifier by using %project% in the regexp.
  #
  # You can also set a custom hint message for each SCM that will be displayed
  # on the repository form instead of the default one.
  #
  # Examples:
  # scm_subversion_path_regexp: file:///svnpath/[a-z0-9_]+
  # scm_subversion_path_info: SVN URL (eg. file:///svnpath/foo)
  #
  # scm_git_path_regexp: /gitpath/%project%(\.[a-z0-9_])?/

  # Absolute path to the SCM commands errors (stderr) log file.

  # If you don't want to enable data encryption, just leave it blank.
  # WARNING: losing/changing this key will make encrypted data unreadable.
  #
  # If you want to encrypt existing data in your database:
  # * set the cipher key here in your configuration file
  # * encrypt data using 'rake db:encrypt RAILS_ENV=production'
  #
  # If you have encrypted data and want to change this key, you have to:
  # * decrypt data using 'rake db:decrypt RAILS_ENV=production' first
  # * change the cipher key here in your configuration file
  # * encrypt data using 'rake db:encrypt RAILS_ENV=production'

  # Configuration of MiniMagick font.
  #
  # Redmine uses MiniMagick in order to export a gantt chart to a PNG image.
  # This setting is necessary to properly display CJK (Chinese, Japanese,
  # and Korean) characters in the PNG image. Please make sure that the
  # specified font is installed in the Redmine server.
  #
  # This setting is necessary only when CJK characters are used in gantt.
  #
  # Note that rmagick_font_path in prior to Redmine 4.1.0 has been renamed
  # to minimagick_font_path.
  #
  # Examples for Japanese:
  #   Windows:
  #     minimagick_font_path: C:\windows\fonts\msgothic.ttc
  #   Linux:
  #     minimagick_font_path: /usr/share/fonts/ipa-mincho/ipam.ttf

  # URL of the avatar server
  #
  # By default, Redmine uses Gravatar as the avatar server for displaying
  # user icons. You can switch to another Gravatar-compatible server such
  # as Libravatar and opensource servers listed on
  # https://wiki.libravatar.org/running_your_own/
  #
  # URL of each avatar is: #{avatar_server_url}/avatar/#{hash}

  #avatar_server_url: https://seccdn.libravatar.org
