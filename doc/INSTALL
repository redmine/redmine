== Redmine installation

Redmine - project management software
Copyright (C) 2006-  Jean-Philippe Lang
https://www.redmine.org/


== Requirements

* Ruby 3.2, 3.3, 3.4

* A database:
  * MySQL (tested with MySQL 8)
  * PostgreSQL (tested with PostgreSQL 14)
  * SQLite3 (tested with SQLite 3.11)
  * SQLServer (tested with SQLServer 2012)

Optional:
* SCM binaries (e.g. svn, git...), for repository browsing (must be
  available in PATH)
* ImageMagick (to enable Gantt export to png images)

Supported browsers:
The current version of Firefox, Safari, Chrome, Chromium and Microsoft Edge.

== Installation

1. Uncompress the program archive

2. Create an empty utf8 encoded database: "redmine" for example

3. Configure the database parameters in config/database.yml
   for the "production" environment (default database is MySQL)

4. Install the required gems by running:
     bundle install --without development test

   Only the gems that are needed by the adapters you've specified in your
   database configuration file are actually installed (eg. if your
   config/database.yml uses the 'mysql2' adapter, then only the mysql2 gem
   will be installed). Don't forget to re-run `bundle install` when you
   change config/database.yml for using other database adapters.

   If you need to load some gems that are not required by Redmine core
   (eg. fcgi), you can create a file named Gemfile.local at the root of
   your redmine directory.
   It will be loaded automatically when running `bundle install`.

5. Generate a session store secret

   Redmine stores session data in cookies by default, which requires
   a secret to be generated. Under the application main directory run:
     bundle exec rake generate_secret_token

   Alternatively, you can store this secret in config/secrets.yml:
   https://guides.rubyonrails.org/upgrading_ruby_on_rails.html#config-secrets-yml

6. Compile assets (optional)

   Compile the assets such as stylesheets, javascripts and images into the public/assets
   directory for web server delivery.

   By default, Redmine automatically recompiles assets in production mode when the application starts.
   This behavior can be controlled using the "config.assets.redmine_detect_update" flag in the configuration file.

   To manually compile assets or if automatic compilation is disabled:

   using:
     bundle exec rake assets:precompile RAILS_ENV="production"

   If deploying to a sub-uri, set the relative URL root as follows:
     bundle exec rake assets:precompile RAILS_ENV="production" RAILS_RELATIVE_URL_ROOT=/sub-uri

   If you experience issues with missing assets in the browser, try
   removing the public/assets directory before re-running the precompile:
     bundle exec rake assets:clobber RAILS_ENV="production"

7. Create the database structure

   Under the application main directory run:
     bundle exec rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV="production"

   It will create all the tables and an administrator account.

8. Setting up permissions (Windows users have to skip this section)

   The user who runs Redmine must have write permission on the following
   subdirectories: files, log, tmp & public/assets.

   Assuming you run Redmine with a user named "redmine":
     sudo chown -R redmine:redmine files log tmp public/assets
     sudo chmod -R 755 files log tmp public/assets

9. Test the installation by running the Puma web server

   Under the main application directory run:
     ruby bin/rails server -e production

   Once Puma has started, point your browser to http://localhost:3000/
   You should now see the application welcome page.

10. Use the default administrator account to log in:
   login: admin
   password: admin

   Go to "Administration" to load the default configuration data (roles,
   trackers, statuses, workflow) and to adjust the application settings

== Database server configuration

When using MySQL with Redmine 5.1.1 or later, it is necessary to change
the transaction isolation level from the default REPEATABLE READ to
READ_COMMITTED. To modify this setting, either change the database
configuration file or alter the settings on your MySQL server.

To set the transaction isolation level in the database configuration file,
add transaction_isolation variable as below:

  production:
    adapter: mysql2
    database: redmine
    host: localhost
    [...]
    variables:
      transaction_isolation: "READ-COMMITTED"

More details can be found in https://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/MySQL_configuration.

== SMTP server Configuration

Copy config/configuration.yml.example to config/configuration.yml and
edit this file to adjust your SMTP settings.
Do not forget to restart the application after any change to this file.

Please do not enter your SMTP settings in environment.rb.
