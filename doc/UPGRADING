== Upgrading

1. Uncompress the program archive in a new directory

2. Copy your database settings (RAILS_ROOT/config/database.yml)
   and your configuration file (RAILS_ROOT/config/configuration.yml)
   into the new config directory
   Note: before Redmine 1.2, SMTP configuration was stored in
   config/email.yml. It should now be stored in config/configuration.yml.

3. Copy the RAILS_ROOT/files directory content into your new installation
   This directory contains all the attached files.

4. Copy the folders of the installed plugins and themes into new installation
   Plugins must be stored in the [redmine_root]/plugins directory
   Themes must be stored in the [redmine_root]/public/themes directory

   WARNING: plugins from your previous Redmine version may not be compatible
   with the Redmine version you're upgrading to.

5. Install the required gems by running:
     bundle install --without development test

   If ImageMagick is not installed on your system, you should skip the installation
   of the rmagick gem using:
     bundle install --without development test rmagick

   Only the gems that are needed by the adapters you've specified in your database
   configuration file are actually installed (eg. if your config/database.yml
   uses the 'mysql2' adapter, then only the mysql2 gem will be installed). Don't
   forget to re-run `bundle install` when you change config/database.yml for using
   other database adapters.

   If you need to load some gems that are not required by Redmine core (eg. fcgi),
   you can create a file named Gemfile.local at the root of your redmine directory.
   It will be loaded automatically when running `bundle install`.

6. Generate a session store secret

   If you're upgrading from Redmine 2.x or below, remove the following file
   if it exists: config/initializers/secret_token.rb

   Then generate a new secret by running the following command under the
   application directory:
     bundle exec rake generate_secret_token

   Alternatively, you can store this secret in config/secrets.yml:
   http://guides.rubyonrails.org/upgrading_ruby_on_rails.html#config-secrets-yml

   DO NOT REPLACE OR EDIT ANY OTHER FILES.

7. Migrate your database

   If you are upgrading to Rails 2.3.14 as part of this migration, you
   need to upgrade the plugin migrations before running the plugin migrations
   using:
     bundle exec rake db:migrate:upgrade_plugin_migrations RAILS_ENV="production"

   Please make a backup before doing this! Under the new application
   directory run:
     bundle exec rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV="production"

   If you have installed any plugins, you should also run their database
   migrations using:
     bundle exec rake db:migrate_plugins RAILS_ENV="production"

8. Clear the cache and the existing sessions by running:
     bundle exec rake tmp:cache:clear tmp:sessions:clear

9. Restart the application server (e.g. mongrel, thin, passenger)

10. Finally go to "Administration -> Roles & permissions" to check/set permissions
    for new features, if any
