  # With SCMs that have a sequential commit numbering,
  # such as Subversion and Mercurial,
  # Redmine is able to be clever and only fetch changesets
  # going forward from the most recent one it knows about.
  #
  # However, Git does not have a sequential commit numbering.
  #
  # In order to fetch only new adding revisions,
  # Redmine needs to save "heads".
  #
  # In Git and Mercurial, revisions are not in date order.
  # Redmine Mercurial fixed issues.
  #    * Redmine Takes Too Long On Large Mercurial Repository
  #      http://www.redmine.org/issues/3449
  #    * Sorting for changesets might go wrong on Mercurial repos
  #      http://www.redmine.org/issues/3567
  #
  # Database revision column is text, so Redmine can not sort by revision.
  # Mercurial has revision number, and revision number guarantees revision order.
  # Redmine Mercurial model stored revisions ordered by database id to database.
  # So, Redmine Mercurial model can use correct ordering revisions.
  #
  # Redmine Mercurial adapter uses "hg log -r 0:tip --limit 10"
  # to get limited revisions from old to new.
  # But, Git 1.7.3.4 does not support --reverse with -n or --skip.
  #
  # The repository can still be fully reloaded by calling #clear_changesets
  # before fetching changesets (eg. for offline resync)
